  7. Android
  As a UX designer, you’ll commonly come across two operating systems: Android and iOS. Android is Google’s open source mobile operating system. Visually, it is characterized by Material Design, a design language developed by Google in 2014.

  But what exactly is an operating system? An operating system is software that supports a product’s key functions. Think of it as the brain of your smartphone.

  8. API
  Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, are pieces of software that help different applications communicate with each other. Products develop APIs to let you access and read information on their server easily.

  9. Avatar
  Avatars represent users online who have not uploaded an image for themselves. You’ll commonly see them in comment threads or in games.

  10. Back and Front-End Development
  You’ll often hear developers talk about front and back-end development. In software development, the terms front and back-end refer to different segments of a product.

  The front-end is what we see. Think buttons, text, beautiful colors and the layer you see on your screen when interacting with a product.

  The back-end powers the front-end but we don’t necessarily see it. Think databases and servers. You can learn more about the difference between front and back-end development here.

  11. Backlog
  The backlog is a list of tasks to be completed. The list is prioritized and ideally the tasks will be completed in the order listed.

  12. Beacon
  Beacons are small Bluetooth radio transmitters. They communicate with the user’s smartphone and are used to share information.

  13. Breadcrumb
  Breadcrumb navigation systems help users understand their location in a website or app. They’ll show a sequence of steps users have take to get where they are.

  14. Bug
  Bugs are mistakes in software that can cause a product to glitch, behave in unintended ways, or even crash.

  15. Cache
  A cache memory lets you store and save data temporarily for later use. You’ll often find usernames, recent searches and websites in your cache memory.

  16. Card Sorting
  In a card sorting exercise, we’ll give users topics, cards, and a Sharpie pen. We will then ask users to write down the topics on the cards and organize them in a way that makes sense to them. This exercises helps us understand and design the information architecture of a site.

  Think of amazon.com. It has a massive inventory! To help create a menu structure and navigation that resonates with users, we might conduct a card sorting exercise.

  17. Chatbot
  Chatbots let you ask the system questions via a chat interface. You can find them everywhere these days. They are a popular customer service tool and resemble the experience of texting a friend.

  18. Clickstream
  When you land on a site, you click your way through it to complete a task. This is what a clickstream represents: the path of clicks you took on it to accomplish a goal.

  19. Commits
  Throughout the development process, developers create commits whenever they have reached a good point in their work. Commits are similar to drafts.

  20. Conversion Rate
  The Conversion Rate of a product or site is the percentage of users who complete a desired action. Say we’re creating an e-comm site and the desired action is a successful purchase. The Conversion Rate would tell us how many users bought an item.

  21. CRM
  Customer Relationship Management software systems help manage business processes, like sales, data, and customer interactions.

  22. CSS
  CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet programming language used to define how a website should be styled.

  It contains information on fonts, color, spacing, layouts, and graphics among others and how each should be applied to the website. Think of the top paint coat!

  23. Customer Experience (CX)
  You’ve decided to purchase a new SUV. You’re not sure which brand or model you want, you just know you want an SUV.

  To make your choice, you compare a few options on each of the brand’s websites. After comparing, you decide you want to purchase a 2017 Nissan Rogue.

  You head down to the dealership and chat with a few sales reps to learn more about your new car. Armed with all there is to know about the 2017 Nissan Rogue, you make the purchase and head home.

  This entire journey is what we call Customer Experience, or CX. It refers to all the different interactions a user has with a brand through its different channels and products, and how a user feels about them.

  24. Data Science
  Numbers can tell us an awful lot about our users and their needs, and can help us define how to best meet them. Data Science focuses on making sense of these numbers or data and uncovering valuable insights that help us make better product decisions.

  25. Design Debt
  When we initially launch a product, we design a well-thought-out and cohesive design system for it. As the product grows, we often add new features and elements and scrap old ones.

  Pressed with deadlines and the desire to move fast, it is easy to skip over the valuable design concepts we started out with. As a result, the new elements or features we add don’t quite fit and a choppy user experience emerges.

  A design system that has accrued design debt is made up of elements and features that will need to be cleaned up later on. The efforts made to quickly set them in place eventually generate more work down the line.

  33. Gamification
  Gamification is the process of integrating game-design elements and principles into products in an effort to drive user engagement.

  34. GitHub
  GitHub is a collaborative development platform used by developers. You can find a comprehensive introduction to GitHub here.

  35. Grid System
  Grids systems are organizational tools that help us arrange content on a screen. They are made up of vertical and horizontal lines that create what we call columns and gutters.

  36. Hardware
  The physical parts parts of a product or computer are called hardware. Think circuits, chips, plugs, and wires.

  37. Heat Map
  A heat map is a graphical representation of the areas on your product that receive the most user attention. They use a warm-to-cool color spectrum to show you where exactly your users are going. The red areas in the heat map below, for example, are the areas users interact with the most on the website.

  38. HTML
  Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is the standard programming language used to create websites. Unlike CSS, it is concerned with the structure of a website. Think of it as the programming language we use to create the blueprint of a website. Learn about HTML in more detail here.

  39. Human-Computer Interaction
  HCI is a field of study concerned with the design and use of computer technology. It studies how we interact with interfaces and computers today.

  40. Hybrid App
  Hybrid mobile apps combine both native and web technologies. They’ll often use a combination of technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will live inside a native container that lets it access device capabilities.

  41. Information Architecture
  Information architecture is the practice of arranging content in a product in an understandable manner. It involves organizing the content we interact with, as well as the different structures, such as the website’s navigation, we need in order to interact with it.

  42. Interaction Design
  Interaction Design, or IxD, is the practice of designing interactive digital products and considering the way in which users will interact with them.

  43. iOS
  iOS is a mobile operating system designed and developed by Apple. If you have an iPhone, this is the OS in your device.

  44. IP Address
  An IP address, or Internet Protocol Address, is a unique number made up of numbers and periods used to identify each device utilizing the Internet Protocol to communicate.

  45. Iteration
  It isn’t uncommon for a product to be chopped up into smaller pieces as it is developed or designed. Iterative development is just that: the practice of breaking down development into small parts. The period of time that we assign to work on each part is referred to as an iteration. They’ll normally last anywhere between 1-4 weeks.

  46. Javascript
  We’ve looked at HTML and CSS, two of the 3 cornerstone technologies in web development. Javascript, the 3rd cornerstone, defines how both the HTML and CSS should behave. Think of it as the language that helps us make elements on a page interactive.

  47. KPI
  KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators, are measurable values that help us understand and track how well a product is doing. As a UX designer, you’ll often work with KPIs like task success rate, user error rate, and time on task.

  48. Landing Page
  Any page a user lands on is considered a landing page. However, landing pages are often tied to ads and search results and are designed to meet specific conversion goals. Not only are they the page a user lands on, but they are also a crucial part of marketing campaigns.

  It’s not uncommon for landing pages that are part of a marketing campaign to be designed slightly differently than normal websites. Often, you’ll find that they do not feature a navigation and tend to push a single action, like a download, purchase or registration.

  49. Lean UX
  Remember Agile? Lean UX, based on Agile, is a collaborative user-centric approach that prioritizes “learning loops” (building, learning, and measuring through iterations) over design documentation.

  50. Material Design
  Material Design, often called just Material, is a design language developed by Google used in Android devices.

  56. Open Source
  Anything you stumble upon that is open source is available for public use, and free. You can use it, modify it, and build with it without running into trouble.

  57. Pairing Development/Pairing Programming
  Pairing development or pairing programming is the practice of working on code in twos. Two developers take turns writing and revising code.

  58. Persona
  A persona is a representation of our target user. They aren’t necessarily a real individual but are constructed using real information and data based on real users.

  Example of a persona

  59. Pixel
  These little guys are the smallest controllable units on our screens. Pixels are literally tiny squares used to construct the images we see on our device displays. They aren’t a specific color, but rather, change to be able to show different images and graphics.

  60. Prototype
  A prototype is a preliminary model of our product used for testing. You’ll often build different fidelity prototypes during the product development process.

  During early stages, you can build paper prototypes (low-fidelity) with pencil and paper to validate concepts or flows. Later on, with flows and concepts validated, you can jump on design software, like Sketch, to build a high-fidelity prototype. Instead of looking like a doodle, prototypes will look like apps on your mobile device do and can be used to fine tune details on your UI.

  61. Pull Request
  Pull requests let developers share changes they’ve made to code with others involved on Github.

  62. Refactoring
  Refactoring is the process of cleaning up and tidying code without affecting functionality, essentially increasing its quality. It isn’t done all at once but rather in small, incremental steps.

  63. Responsive
  Not be to confused with adaptive, responsive websites adapt to fit the device they are being displayed on. They are a single layout that shrinks and stretches and rearranges the content on it to be easily viewed on each device type.

  64. SaaS
  Software as a Service, or SaaS, is a software distribution model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and hosted on external servers. Subscribing users are able to access it through the web. Think Invision.

  65. Scrum
  Scrum is an agile software development framework.

  66. SDK
  A software development kit, or SDK, is a software package that contains the tools required to develop products for a specific platform or operating system. They help expedite the development process by providing “parts” developers can use instead of having to write the code for them from scratch.

  67. SEO
  Search engine optimization is the process of increasing a website’s visibility in free, or organic, search results. It often involves writing useful content on a website around words and phrases users use in searches related to the brand’s product or service.

  68. Site map
  A site map is a visual representation of a website’s pages and hierarchy.

  69. Sketching
  We do it all the time as designers. Sketching is quick freehand drawing intended to help us brainstorm and jot down ideas. Sketches aren’t really polished or finished products—think of them as visual note-taking.

  70. Slack
  Slack is an internal messaging platform for teams. It is huge in product development. If you’re taking a course with us, you’re probably using it to connect with you peers and the CareerFoundry community.

  71. Software
  We’ve gone over hardware or the physical parts of a computer. Running on it, you’ll find a collection of programs called software. Software can be anything from an app to the tools you use on your computer, like Sketch.

  72. Sprints
  In agile software development, we call defined periods of time assigned to complete certain tasks “sprints.” Their length can vary but is usually around 1-3 weeks.

  73. Storyboard
  Storyboards are a visual representation of a user’s experience with a product or problem space. They are a film technique we’ve adopted and look a lot like comic strips.

  79. Unit Testing
  The process of testing parts of an application to ensure they’re working properly. It can be done manually or can be an automated process.

  80. Usability Testing
  Usability testing is a research method that lets us evaluate how easy a product is to use by testing it on a group of representative users.

  81. User-Centered Design
  Like the term suggests, user-centered design, or UCD, is an iterative design framework in which users and their needs are always kept at the center of every decision.

  82. User Experience (UX)
  The user experience refers to a user’s emotions, attitude, and perceptions about a product, system, or service. In other words, it is how you feel while interacting with an app or website. Good UX makes a product useful, usable, desirable, findable, accessible, and credible.

  83. User Flow
  A user flow describes the intended series of steps a user needs to take to complete a goal on a product. They often include a name, steps and a description of what happens during each step.

  84. User Interface
  The user interface is a set of visual components a user needs to interact with a product, made up of UI elements (see below).

  85. User Journey Maps
  User Journey Maps are narrative documents that help us visualize the process a user goes through in order to accomplish a goal. They document the stages the user goes through, the tasks executed during each stage, user emotions, and product opportunities.

  86. User Scenario
  Used in early stages of a product, user scenarios are mini stories that describe the needs and/or context that brings a user to your product. They tell us who the user is, why the user is interested in your product, and what his or her goals are.
